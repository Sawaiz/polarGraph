Polargraph changelog.

2013-07-20
polargraph_server_polarshield: 1.7
- Small fix for issue where pen is not lifted between lines on the norwegian pixel.
- Added facility to use a 2.4 inch screen.  This is in the form of a pair of #defines
in the main file, one of which should be commented out. The 2.2 inch screen is still 
the default.

2013-05-12
polargraph_server_*: 1.66 (changed the version on mega back to being in sync)
- Corrected bad casting on floats in previous version, ha.

2013-05-11
polagraph_server_a1, polargraph_server_polarshield: 1.65, polargraph_server_mega: 1.7a
- Added casting to float when doing calculations that multiply longs.  

2013-05-09
polargraphcontroller: 1.6
- Removed live webcam feature, it now draws from the loaded image (bitmap).
Still a couple of quirks, but this is to get it out there.

2013-05-05
- Included WinVDIG 1.0.5 in the archive.

polargraph_server_a1: 1.63
- Fixed problem that meant that "currentlyRunning" was false, and so nothing
moved.  Duh.
- Moved copies of EEPROMAnything.h into sketch folders rather than have
it as a library.  Just feels better that way.

2013-04-30
polargraph_server_mega: 1.7a
- Contains beta stuff for a new swirling roving style.  It is the most infuriating
thing I have ever witnessed.

polargraph_server_a1: 1.62
- HA! Version for Arduino UNO.  This loads on an UNO, but is too large for a
Duemilanove.

Controller: 1.5
- Added a the swirl rove render buttons required to use the 1.7a firmware.

2013-04-27
Server: 1.62
- Fixed significant bug that caused vector lines (move direct / C17) to be finished
off with too much of a flourish.  It caused the drawing to get progressively higher 
and higher on the surface.  So that's not cool.  I could not replicate the issue
in polargraph_server_polarshield, only in polargraph_server_mega (using the adafruit
motorshield), so I'm a bit puzzled about what it is.  Anyway, I have also applied the
fix in p_s_polarshield.
- Changed pen lift height test so it ends with the pen up (lifted), rather than down.

Controller: 1.5
- Can buttons to rotate live webcam image, preview live and processed video
feed, flip video left to right.

2013-04-21
Server: 1.61
- EEPROM_anything is the general purpose eeprom saver/loader routine.  It alerted 
me that I was saving a float (which was four bytes) into an address that was
only two.  So it wasn't reloading properly.  So the addresses have been 
changed.  Note that you will need to upload your machine size again after loading this 
firmware.

Controller: 1.42
- Now possible to set picture frame size even if there is no image loaded.

2013-04-20
Server: 1.6
- Circular pixel (spiral) now working FAST.  Sorted out, and looking very
beautiful.  The acceleration profile can cause some problems when drawing very tiny circles, but fix by reducing acceleration.

Controller: 1.41
- Renamed circular pixel to spiral pixel.

2013-04-19
- Source code now being kept in github rather than google's SVN system.
https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller
https://github.com/euphy/polargraph_server_polarshield
https://github.com/euphy/polargraph_server_mega

Though the google project page will be kept for the time being, and
downloads there will be maintained.

Controller: 1.4
- Added webcam feature to draw sketches from live video feed.  This
requires the wonderful Diewald CV kit library, written by Thomas Diewald.
This is available from http://thomasdiewald.com/processing/libraries/diewald_CV_kit/
- Added vector line sorting.  Standard sorting is "none", but longest first,
largest area first and centre-first are available internally.  Centre-first
was designed for the live drawer to allow the most important features to be 
drawn first, and background later.  Totally worked.
- Keyboard shortcuts now require "ctrl+" to work.  So ctrl-c for console.  Ctrl-i
for info, that kind of thing.  This is to prevent these things from being
triggered why trying to type into text fields.  That was driving me mental.
- Vector handle (for moving) is now in the centre of the shape, and resizing 
happens from the centre too.
- Return to home button.
- Pen lift positions configurable, with "test range" function.

Server: 1.5
- Pen lift positions are now configurable and can be saved to eeprom. The 
settings take the form of an up position and a down position.  The C13 and C14
commands now take an optional second parameter that sets the position to go to.
Setting it that way does NOT save to eeprom.
Pen lift code contributed by Andreas (Televio - http://www.polargraph.co.uk/
forum/?mingleforumaction=viewtopic&t=182), thanks!
- Pen lift range test function, C45 takes an up, down position and a third 
value to control if it is a test or a save.  If the value is 0, or missing,
then a range test is performed (just a back-and-forth wiggle to the chosen 
points) and the values set for that session.  IF the value is 1, then the
value is set in EEPROM too.
- Speed and acceleration can be saved to eeprom too now, with an optional
1 (save) parameter added to the regular set speed commands.  eg C31,<speed>,1,END.
- Comms is much faster.  I am a little suspicious of how safe it is, but I've 
not seen it fail, so fingers crossed.
- Fixed a problem introduced by a fix in v1.2x of AccelStepper, that made for
ridiculous vector drawing.  This fix may not be backwards compatible with 
older versions of AccelStepper (older than todays: 1.31).  But probably is.

Unfortunately this version no longer fits on an Arduino Duemilanove.  I think it 
might be a couple of extra features in accelstepper, but that might just be
scapegoating the brilliant Mike MacAuley, and it's probably my rubbish.  It 
might still fit on an UNO, but until I can test it, this distro contains only
updates for the MEGA based machines.  UNO owners should continue to use the
1.2x firmware, with an Accelstepper version 1.17.
